### Project Title
Bike Share Data Analysis

### Description
In this project, Python was used to explore data (provided by Motivate) related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The script takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present statistics for a requested city.

These are the statistics computed:

1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time) of the following:
most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day

2 Popular stations and trip of the following:
most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

3 Trip duration of the following:
total travel time
average travel time

4 User info of the following:
counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Files used
bikeshare.py is the main script. This project also uses three city dataset files: chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, and washington.csv

### Credits
The project description was taken from Udacity's "Explore US Bikeshare Data" Project Overview and Details sections.
